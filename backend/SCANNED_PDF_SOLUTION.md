# Scanned PDF Processing Solution

## What was fixed:

1. **Installed pdf2image and poppler** - Required for converting PDF pages to images
2. **Enhanced DocumentExtractor** - Now detects scanned PDFs and processes them page by page
3. **Page-by-page extraction** - Each page is converted to an image and processed with Claude Vision

## How it works:

1. When a PDF has no extractable text (0 characters), it's detected as scanned
2. The system converts each PDF page to a high-quality image (200 DPI)
3. Each page image is sent to Claude Vision for text extraction
4. All page contents are combined into the final extracted text
5. This text is then used by the dataset generator to create training data

## Result:

- Scanned PDFs now generate multiple rows of training data
- Each page is properly extracted and analyzed
- The AI can understand tables, forms, handwritten text, and complex layouts
- The dataset generator receives rich content instead of placeholder text

## Testing:

Try uploading a scanned PDF and clicking "Generate Dataset" - you should now see:
- Multiple rows of generated training data
- Content extracted from all pages
- Proper formatting based on your selected dataset type (Q&A, Classification, etc.)
